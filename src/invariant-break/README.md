# Invariants

Invariants are properties of a program or system that must always remain true. 

For example:
- For an ERC20 token, the sum of user balances MUST always be less than or equal to the total supply. 
- In the [Aave](https://aave.com/) protocol, it MUST always have more value in collateral than value in loans. 

With this in mind, if we understand the core invariant of a system, we can write tests to test specifically for that invariant.
